## Background
This project was sponsored by Professor Pradeep Atrey at the University at Albany
Team Members include: Mason Wolfe, Jordan Rivera, Joey Saline, and Sydney Pennington

## Backend
The backend of this project is not included in this repository because I do not have and did not write the code. Mason Wolfe and Jordan Rivera built the backend with Azure Cloud Services and an ejabberd server using java 

## Full Applicaiton
The finished application worked cross platform between iOS, Android and the Web. This repository holds the entire iOS implementation written by me.

This was built using Xcode and Xcode simulators. I also used my own phone for testing.
